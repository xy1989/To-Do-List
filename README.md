![Image](example.JPG?raw=true)

The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding the integration between Python, SQLite, and Kivy/KivyMD in creating a simple program. Despite Kivy/KivyMD being focused on design for mobile devices, this program was not designed to be used as such.

Functionality:
 - Type in the textbox (e.g. a task of some kind)
 - Add the text to a list of task by clicking on the plus icon
 - Click the checkbox to move the task to the completed list
 - Click on the trash can icon to clear the completed list
